### Inventing Wheels

Recently I had the opportunity to work independently and develop new skills.

For a tech-oriented person like me, coding and development can fill hours every day, and that is at least half the job.

The best way to learn about wheels is to build them. And a great way to become a better programmer is to write a lot of code - and present the work.

Here's my first article, it is about custom parsing and [meta-programming in C].



Project source code is posted [on github].
